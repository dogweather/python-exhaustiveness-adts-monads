# python-exhaustiveness-checking

Demo code showing off the new true exhaustiveness checks with Python 3.10 + Pyright.
I created this repo to support my blog post and make it easy to try out
this technique.

## To set up

You'll need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) and Python 3.10. I used 3.10.7.

```
poetry install
```
